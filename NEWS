v0.2	2010-07-30	leaner and meaner

Memory usage and speed have both been improved, in part by
reading the entire file into a strict ByteString and making
two parsing passes over it, where the first pass accumulates
statistics and the second pass extracts the relevant data to
arrays, thus avoid large intermediate data structures.

Code abtraction has been improved, by separating the SVG
code into its own module and providing a Graphics interface,
so that later a PostScript implementation can be added more
easily.
