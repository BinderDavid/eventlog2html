hp2pretty
=========

hp2ps is a tool to generate PostScript graphs of Heap Profiles.
hp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with
the aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and
more beautiful output.  Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.
Also none (count'em) of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in
hp2pretty.

Essentially identical runtime!
