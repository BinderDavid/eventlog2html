hp2pretty
=========

hp2ps is a tool to generate PostScript graphs of Heap Profiles.
hp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with
the aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and
more beautiful output.  Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.
Not all of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in hp2pretty.


Usage
=====

    hp2pretty - generate pretty graphs from heap profiles
    
    Usage: hp2pretty [--uniform-scale AXES] [--sort FIELD] [--reverse]
                     [--trace PERCENT] [--bands COUNT] [--pattern] FILES...
      Convert heap profile FILES.hp to pretty graphs FILES.svg
    
    Available options:
      --uniform-scale AXES     Whether to use a uniform scale for all outputs. One
                               of: none (default), time, memory, both.
      --sort FIELD             How to sort the bands. One of: size (default),
                               stddev, name.
      --reverse                Reverse the order of bands.
      --trace PERCENT          Percentage of trace elements to
                               combine. (default: 1.0)
      --bands COUNT            Maximum number of bands to draw (0 for
                               unlimited). (default: 15)
      --pattern                Use patterns instead of solid colours to fill bands.
      FILES...                 Heap profiles (FILE.hp will be converted to
                               FILE.svg).
      -h,--help                Show this help text
